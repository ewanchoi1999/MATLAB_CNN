# Segmentation of image dataset through deep learning

### This project encompasses matlab files for the segmentation of a flowers dataset through CNNs. 2 Methods were employed - Reusing an existing segmentation model (DeepLabV3+) and building our own CNN model, with training from scratch. Both methods involved the cleaning of data (deletion of images with no labels) to enhance the modelsâ€™ performance.

### You can find the matlab files, the datasets, as well as a report I wrote to discuss the performance of the CNNs.
